                        <p id="profile__blurb">Just like any other high school students, Shiva applied to Simon Fraser
                            University and once she received her acceptance letter she was overwhelmed with happiness
                            and excitement. While reading the letter Shiva learned that she got admitted to her first
                            choice of program.......
                            </br>Computer Science??? You see Shiva never planned to study Computer Science and upon some
                            research her heart dropped when she realized that she made a mistake while she was filling
                            in her application. Too terrified and uncertain regarding the potential consequences of
                            admitting her mistake for choosing the wrong program, she accepted her fate (aka she wasn't
                            sure who would be more mad, her mother or SFU). Shiva didn't know anything about computers,
                            she didn't own any laptops or computers, and she wasn't sure what computer science meant or
                            what was it about? Was it like biology but for computers? She didn't know and that's how she
                            began her first year of university.
                            </br>Well it's safe to say that Shiva started enjoying computer science and writing code. In
                            fact she thought she was a genius when she wrote her first program which just added 3 to 4
                            but she felt proud and really good about it. Shiva is now a fourth plus year Computing
                            Science student at Simon Fraser University. She just finished her first internship at Sierra
                            Wireless and she was the Vice President of the Computing Science Student Society. As clumsy
                            as she sometimes can get we think she is pretty lucky and she is doing fine.
